                <p>The Madrid Spain Temple, built in the Pavones neighborhood of Moratalaz, a district of Madrid, was announced in 1993. The temple in Madrid is a highly visible symbol of the church's presence in Spain. During the open house, over 100,000 community members and government officials toured the temple, including King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía. LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley went to Spain to dedicate the Madrid Spain Temple and had his third visit with the King and Queen. During the visit, Hinckley presented them with a special gift created by well-known Spanish artists: a Lladró figurine of the Christus, modeled after the original by Bertel Thorvaldsen. Jose Lladro, president of the Lladro Company, had personally delivered the first five issues of the figurine to Hinckley at the temple site. One of the five figurines is now on permanent display in the temple foyer.</p>

Hallstrom, an area seventy, Hilo stake president John Sakamaki and Kona stake president Philip A. Harris each spoke at the ceremony. Dickson turned over the first shovelful of dirt, after which other onlookers, including many children, also participated.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Church leaders discussed building a temple in the western part of Idaho as early as 1939. However, with the majority of church's membership in the eastern part of Idaho, the leaders decided against it and concentrated on building the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple. Forty-five years later, on March 31, 1982, church leaders announced that a temple would be built in the Boise area. The temple site is located near an exit from Interstate 84 and is very visible to those traveling along the highway and is also a visible landmark for pilots at Boise Airport.</p>
